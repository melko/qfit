qfit is a small data analysis software that can do fits.

The project is to make a cli and a Qt interface based on FitTools.

Building qfit (linux)
-------------------------

cmake allows to build sources in a different folder so that there is no
mix between sources and blobs.
In order to build qfit you need at least a compiler,
cmake is also recommended.

From the sources' dir:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
# make install (optional)(needs super-user privileges)

Qt libs are needed to build the Gui, if you want the plot widget, also
the Qwt libs are needed (you need at least Qwt6, Qwt5 won't work).

you can state some arguments to cmake to change the default behaviour

use
$ cmake -D USE_GUI=OFF
to not build the Qt interface

*WARNING*
A lot ot distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora & co split headers from libraries,
(usually splitted packages have a -dev or -devel suffix).
In order to build qfit gui, you need these headers (qt4-dev and qwt-dev),
while they aren't needed anymore to run the binary.

File format
-------------------------

qfit can read just simple text files. A data file must have at least two
columns (the first for the x data and the second for the y data).
If you don't set explicity a custom error value for the y array, the
file must have also a third column for the y errors!

Thanks to the Qt framework, qfit should work also for platforms different
than linux, but of course these are not supported by me.
