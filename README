qfit is a small data analysis software that do simple tasks like fitting.

The project is to make a cli and a Qt interface based on FitTools.

Building qfit (linux)
-------------------------

cmake allows to build sources in a different folder so that there is no
mix between sources and blobs.
In order to build qfit you need at least the GNU Compiler and GNU Make,
cmake is also needed.

From the sources' dir:

# mkdir build && cd build
# cmake ..
# make
# make install (optional)(needs super-user privileges)

Qt libs are needed to build the Gui

you can state some arguments to cmake to change the defauld behaviour

use
# cmake -D USE_GUI=OFF
to not build the Qt interface

Thanks to the Qt framework, qfit should work also for platforms different
than linux, but of course these are not supported by me.
